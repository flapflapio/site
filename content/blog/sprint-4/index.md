## Summary

Sprint 4 is now completed! 

The purpose of this sprint was to beef up the Machinist project. We improved some of our UI design and the backend APIs. We wanted to incorporate a new notion into our backend apis which is websockets!

15 Jira issues were assigned in this sprint in which 7 of them were completed and 8 of them were moved to the next sprint.
